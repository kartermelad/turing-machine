# Turing Machine

* Author: Karter Melad & Hunter Walp

## Overview

The Turing Machine project is a Java-based simulation of a Turing Machine, a major
concept in computer science. The machine is created using states, symbols, and
transitions, which are loaded from a text file. It works by reading symbols from a
tape, fetching the transition, and applying it. This process continues until the
machine reaches a halt.

## Compiling and Using

First, compile the .java files by running the 'javac *.java' command. Run
the simulation after compiling by using the following command 'java TM filename'.
Filename is the name of the file containing the TM's configuration. This file
will determine the number of states, number of symbols, transition function, and
tape contents.

The turing machine was an interesting culmination of all of the previous projects
and assignments. I have found turing machines to be a little bit more intuitive than
some of the other state machines, especially PDAs. Karter got the project started
early, which helped us to plan ahead and test fairly comprehensively. With the added
challenge of getting a turing machine to run effeciently, we (mostly karter, actually)
figured that we may be able to use a hash map. This increased the effeciency of our TM 
by many times over. 

With Karter's early work on the TM implementation, it made it really easy for me to 
start testing and re-working some of our functionality. I think that I enjoyed this 
project the most out of all 3, as TMs seem to work more intuitively in my brain than
some of the other state machines. Overall, I think this project was the easiest, even
though Turing machines can be quite complicated.
